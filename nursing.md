## Notes

* Over all time of transportation from north to 2 nursing home in south is neraly 1hr
* if you ask me to choose a south nursing home while staying near to dart line in north I prefer Dalkey because of less walk
* If we stay in south , for me equal prefernce for
  + Dalkey & Dún Laoghaire south
  + Bellvilla Community Unit & Baggot Street Hospital
* I will only consider Nursing home in Dublin 9 and 11 with least priorty if only stay in north some where near Beaumount or Drumcondra.
